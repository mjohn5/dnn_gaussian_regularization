# dnn_gaussian_regularization

contains codes (developed by Sujit Vettam) used for Gaussian regularization presented in John, Vettam and Wu (2022): arXiv: 2204.03123

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03123.pdf

1) codes for DNN architecture applied on MNIST dataset is included (the same DNN architecture was applied on FMNIST and RCV1 datasets)

2) codes for CNN architecture applied on SVHN dataset is also included (the same CNN architecture was applied on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImagNet datasets mentioned in the paper).
